                  <h2>History of Millard County</h2>
                  <br>
                <p>Millard County’s economic history tells a continual story of hope, prosperity, transition, and a display of pioneer spirit of perseverance and determination. 
                The first pioneers settled the area on October 28, 1851. They were members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and were assigned to settle the area. Soon after these pioneers arrived, Brigham Young, the leader of Deseret (Utah) Territory, determined that Fillmore would be the location of the Territory Capital.  
                These pioneers wasted no time in building a city in the desert. They constructed and established a school within 15 days of arrival. They also started constructing a fort to keep the area safe from Indians or other possible threats. They also built houses and started farming the area.
                The economy grew and developed as the pioneers set up their life in Millard County. The first gristmill was built in 1863.  By 1870 2,753 people lived in the County. There were music and drama productions for entertainment. And the original agriculture of wheat and other crops gained the addition of orchards, producing peaches and apples. In 1870 the economy also expanded to include cattle ranches. 
                1870 and 1900 were extremely profitable years for crops, where they were worth the most cash value. A big part of this increased value is attributable to the mining camps in surrounding areas, and the resulting increase in demand. Towards the end of the 19th century, the residents discovered that alfalfa was a very lucrative crop that grew well in the area. Rail lines also came into the county, and Millard became not only farming but also a transportation economy.
                The 1920s brought automobiles, service stations, and tourism to Millard County, especially East Millard County. In 1923 the film Covered Wagons was filmed in the County. Also a creamery that was originally built in 1913 was destroyed by fire but rebuilt and expanded in 1919. Some of the products from this creamery were transported up to Salt Lake City to be sold. 
                The 1920s also marked the beginning of power generation in the county. The Deseret Irrigation Company in Oasis originally provided the power, but the Telluride Power Company purchased the power plant in the 1930s. They produced power for local consumption. 
                The Great Depression hit Millard County hard. During this time the economy really shifted towards more livestock and less crops. People had already been leaving the area because of insect problems, and this just further exasperated the flight. The smaller towns grew smaller while Fillmore, Delta and Scipio actually increased in size. Overall, the County declined in population and this decline continued until the 1970s.
                World War 2 brought back some economic vitality. Many men and a few women from Millard served in the armed forces. Women and children took over much of the farming efforts. The Topaz Internment Camp for Japanese Americans was built in West Millard County. An airport was also built just west of Fillmore.
                The economy expanded in other ways as well. Around this time mining for fluorspar and manganese ores added vitality to the economy. Later uranium was also mined, but only for a few years. DDT was also introduced around this time. It had a dramatic impact on alfalfa production, more than quadrupling it! A hospital was built in Delta in the 1960s and a later replacement was built in 1985.
                HISTORY OF IPP
                By far the largest economic change to come in the County arrived in 1977. The Intermountain Power Plant was not well received at first. It required a lot of water and people were worried it would further destroy agriculture in the area. Despite opposition the project moved forward.
                The idea for the Intermountain Power Plant first formed in 1973 with different municipalities in Southern California. In 1974 they started searching for different locations within Utah for the power generation site. In 1978 the Power Sales Contracts were signed in Utah, and in 1980 the participating California municipalities signed it.
                IPP’s construction period brought more crime then the county had previously experienced. People also worried that a lot of speculative buildings would be constructed. This did not really happen due to high interest rates and the high level of uncertainty.  Delta City Officials also discouraged this through strict zoning laws and a plan to assess impact fees.
                The construction period did bring a lot of people into the area, but not as much as expected. Only about a third of the workers lived in apartments, trailer parks or rented homes. Another third lived at the man camp during the week, and the last third continued to live in other counties and would make the commute into Millard every day.
                IPP plant spawned a lot of secondary business growth in Delta. Their property taxes also provided funds for the reconstruction of school house and the hospital. The impact of IPP plant was furthered by the Beryllium mill, microwave and other new jobs. In addition to bringing in population for the first time since the 1930s, these new jobs also started to shift the power away from the east side of the county towards the west. 
                As seen throughout their history, the residents of Millard County have always worked hard, overcome opposition and managed to survive and thrive. The question is what will this next economic transition bring?
